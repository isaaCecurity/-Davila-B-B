## 2026-08-10 · Multi-organization membership & offline sync foundation

**Scope:** B1–B4. Applied to live project `tvfyxpafbpnkneujcnvr`.

**Migrations applied (11)** — `20260810141258` … `20260810182611`, indexed in
`supabase/migrations/README-multiorg-2026-08-10.md`.

**Functions changed:** `set_active_organization` (new), `is_member_of` (new),
`is_authorized_for_branch` (new), `guard_user_role_integrity`,
`custom_access_token_hook`, `accept_organization_invite`, `sync_validate_device`,
`process_sync_batch`, `process_sync_batch_context_validated`.

**Policies changed:** `profiles_update_self`, `profiles_select`,
`profiles_update_admin`, `organizations_select`, `sync_changes_select`,
`sync_devices_*` (3), `sync_operations_select`.

**Schema:** `profiles.active_tenant_id` added; `sync_devices.tenant_id`/`branch_id`
dropped; `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on 7 tables.

**Three defects found and fixed beyond plan:**
1. `guard_user_role_integrity()` required `user_roles.tenant_id = profiles.tenant_id`,
   making a second membership impossible to insert.
2. `jsonb_set()` is STRICT — a null active organization made the token hook return
   NULL. Present in the previously deployed hook *and* the repo's unapplied hardened
   version; never exercised because the case could not exist under single-tenancy.
3. `profiles_select`/`profiles_update_admin` matched staff on `profiles.tenant_id`,
   so a Bakery B admin could not see a driver whose home organization was Bakery A.

**Verification actually executed:**
- `pytest -q` → 12 passed
- `assert_schema_invariants()` → clean
- Security suite S1–S13 + G1/G2 → 15/15
- `tsc --noEmit` (strict) → exit 0
- `eslint .` → exit 0
- `expo install --check` → up to date
- `expo prebuild --platform android --clean` → exit 0, no warnings
- `expo-doctor` → 19/20 (the failure is a TLS error reaching Expo's API)
- Duplicate check → single `react@19.2.3`, single `expo@57.0.12`
- Live row counts after fixture teardown → 0 users / 0 orgs / 0 operations

**Native verification:** `android/gradle.properties` contains
`expo.sqlite.useSQLCipher=true`; 11 Expo modules and 6 RN modules autolinked.

**Not done (deliberate):** per-entity operation application; the gateway records
authorized operations only.

## 2026-08-10 · Agency agent setup

Installed 9 specialists into `.claude/agents/` with a BakeFlow governance preamble;
staged 4 deferred agents in `.claude/agents-deferred/`; created the 7 control files.
No BakeFlow feature code was written.
