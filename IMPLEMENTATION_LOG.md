## 2026-08-10 · Multi-organization membership & offline sync foundation

**Scope:** B1–B4. Applied to live project `tvfyxpafbpnkneujcnvr`.

**Migrations applied (11)** — `20260810141258` … `20260810182611`, indexed in
`supabase/migrations/README-multiorg-2026-08-10.md`.

**Functions changed:** `set_active_organization` (new), `is_member_of` (new),
`is_authorized_for_branch` (new), `guard_user_role_integrity`,
`custom_access_token_hook`, `accept_organization_invite`, `sync_validate_device`,
`process_sync_batch`, `process_sync_batch_context_validated`.

**Policies changed:** `profiles_update_self`, `profiles_select`,
`profiles_update_admin`, `organizations_select`, `sync_changes_select`,
`sync_devices_*` (3), `sync_operations_select`.

**Schema:** `profiles.active_tenant_id` added; `sync_devices.tenant_id`/`branch_id`
dropped; `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on 7 tables.

**Three defects found and fixed beyond plan:**
1. `guard_user_role_integrity()` required `user_roles.tenant_id = profiles.tenant_id`,
   making a second membership impossible to insert.
2. `jsonb_set()` is STRICT — a null active organization made the token hook return
   NULL. Present in the previously deployed hook *and* the repo's unapplied hardened
   version; never exercised because the case could not exist under single-tenancy.
3. `profiles_select`/`profiles_update_admin` matched staff on `profiles.tenant_id`,
   so a Bakery B admin could not see a driver whose home organization was Bakery A.

**Verification actually executed:**
- `pytest -q` → 12 passed
- `assert_schema_invariants()` → clean
- Security suite S1–S13 + G1/G2 → 15/15
- `tsc --noEmit` (strict) → exit 0
- `eslint .` → exit 0
- `expo install --check` → up to date
- `expo prebuild --platform android --clean` → exit 0, no warnings
- `expo-doctor` → 19/20 (the failure is a TLS error reaching Expo's API)
- Duplicate check → single `react@19.2.3`, single `expo@57.0.12`
- Live row counts after fixture teardown → 0 users / 0 orgs / 0 operations

**Native verification:** `android/gradle.properties` contains
`expo.sqlite.useSQLCipher=true`; 11 Expo modules and 6 RN modules autolinked.

**Not done (deliberate):** per-entity operation application; the gateway records
authorized operations only.

## 2026-08-10 · Agency agent setup

Installed 9 specialists into `.claude/agents/` with a BakeFlow governance preamble;
staged 4 deferred agents in `.claude/agents-deferred/`; created the 7 control files.
No BakeFlow feature code was written.

---

## 2026-08-10 · VERIFICATION pass — authorization foundation (steps 1–6)

Read-only re-verification of the multi-organization authorization foundation against
the live project, plus one new behavioural test. No migrations were applied.

**Verified against the live database (all PASS):**

| Step | Assertion | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `profiles_update_self` WITH CHECK pins `active_tenant_id`, `tenant_id`, `primary_branch_id`, `status`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | `pg_policy` |
| 2 | `profiles.active_tenant_id` is `uuid` NULL with FK to `organizations`; `set_active_organization()` is SECURITY DEFINER, pins `search_path`, validates membership **and** `status='active'`; EXECUTE granted to `authenticated`, denied to `anon` | `information_schema`, `pg_proc`, `has_function_privilege` |
| 3 | Token hook reads `active_tenant_id`, filters `user_roles.deleted_at` + `roles.deleted_at` + profile `status`/`deleted_at`, scopes roles to the active organization only, and coalesces the null tenant so `jsonb_set`'s STRICT behaviour cannot return NULL | `pg_get_functiondef` |
| 4 | `guard_user_role_integrity()` no longer requires `profiles.tenant_id = NEW.tenant_id` (multi-org membership insertable) while still enforcing branch-belongs-to-organization; `organizations_select`, `profiles_select`, `profiles_update_admin` all resolve via `user_roles` | `pg_get_functiondef`, `pg_policy` |
| 5 | `accept_organization_invite` has no "already belongs to a different organization" rejection, seeds `profiles.tenant_id` only when NULL, sets `active_tenant_id` only when NULL | `pg_get_functiondef` |
| 6 | `sync_devices` has no `tenant_id`/`branch_id`; FORCE RLS on `sync_devices` + `sync_operations`; `sync_validate_device` returns `uuid` and checks ownership + revocation; no sync function references `current_tenant_id()`; internal helpers not EXECUTE-able by `authenticated`/`anon`; inner processor takes 3 args (no batch-level tenant) | `pg_proc`, `pg_class`, `has_function_privilege` |

`assert_schema_invariants()` — executed, no violations.
Row counts before and after — 0 users / 0 orgs / 0 profiles / 0 devices / 0 operations / 0 branches.

**Test-coverage gap found and closed.** A textual ordering check on
`is_authorized_for_branch()` produced a false negative (the word "owner" appears in an
explanatory comment above the branch check). Reading the body confirmed the ordering is
correct — but it revealed that no *behavioural* test covered the cross-organization
branch case. S2 only covered an unauthorized branch inside the actor's own organization.

Added **S2b** to `tests/sql/security_multiorg_sync.sql` and executed it: a user who is
**owner** in Bakery A (organization-wide authority) submitting an operation for Bakery A
that names Branch B2 (a branch of Bakery B) is refused, and zero rows are written.
Fixtures were removed; counts returned to 0.

Security suite is now **16 assertions** (S1, S2, S2b, S3, S4, S5a–d, S6–S13, G1, G2).

**No implementation work was performed. B7 was not started.**

---

## 2026-08-10 · B5 — PLAN phase only, stopped at the gate

Attempted B5 (per-entity sync operation application). **Stopped at PLAN. No code
written, no migration applied, no business table touched.** Live row counts unchanged
at 0.

**Inspected:** `tickets`/`ticket_items` columns; the five ticket guard functions;
trigger firing order on `tickets`; `docs/STATE-MACHINES.md` §1 and §63-70;
`docs/OFFLINE-SYNC-MODEL.md` conflict sections (§335, §659-663, §1018-1047).

**Verified against the live database (not read from docs):**

| Finding | Query result |
|---|---|
| Trigger order on `tickets` | `prevent_submitted_ticket_update -> tickets_assign_number -> tickets_guard_status_transition -> tickets_set_updated_at -> trg_guard_driver_created_ticket_assignment -> trg_guard_ticket_actor_assignment` |
| `prevent_submitted_ticket_update()` guards `status` | true — so it pre-empts the transition guard |
| Guards `subtotal_amount` / `total_amount` | **false / false** |
| `guard_ticket_item_mutation()` includes `submitted` | **false** |
| `sync_conflicts` table exists | **false** |
| `tickets` / `customers` rows | 0 / 0 |

**Conclusion.** Both defects documented in `docs/STATE-MACHINES.md` §63-70 are real and
still deployed: onward ticket transitions are unreachable, and a submitted ticket's
money is not frozen. Additionally the `sync_conflicts` table the sync model references
does not exist, and no per-entity conflict strategy or applier contract is defined.

An applier built on this would either fail on every transition past `submitted` or
silently rewrite finalised totals. `docs/STATE-MACHINES.md` §70 records the owner's
2026-08-10 decision not to write the remediation migration, so overriding it was not
an option.

**Raised:** BLOCKER-005 (ticket guards), BLOCKER-006 (conflict strategy / applier
contract), with matching NOTIFICATIONS entries. `CURRENT_TASK.md` marks B5 BLOCKED.

**B7 was not started**, per the human's explicit gate.

## 2026-08-11 · P11.1 — Lint/typecheck/spec CI gate (PARTIAL)

Established the quality gate the loop depends on. **No database logic, business rule,
sync behaviour, financial rule or frontend feature was touched. Zero migrations.**

**Problem.** Zero files in the repository were being linted. `npm run lint` exited 2
because `expo lint` globs `apps/mobile/components`, a directory that does not exist, so
ESLint aborted before reading a file (TD-011). Separately, `packages/*` sat outside the
only flat config's base path, leaving all 1,713 lines of the P4.1a catalog read path
unlinted (TD-010).

**Changed.**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `bakeflow-frontend/eslint.config.js` | new — root flat config for `packages/*`, ignoring `apps/**` |
| `bakeflow-frontend/apps/mobile/package.json` | `lint`: `expo lint` → `eslint . --max-warnings=0` |
| `bakeflow-frontend/package.json` | root `lint` also runs `eslint . --max-warnings=0` |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | new — lint + typecheck + pytest on push to `main` and every PR |

Two configs rather than one because flat config does **not** merge across directories:
ESLint resolves exactly one config walking up from the cwd. They own disjoint paths so
they can never both claim a file.

**Executed evidence.**

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` (root) | exit 0 |
| `npm run lint --workspace apps/mobile` | exit 0, **7 files** |
| `npx eslint . --format json` (root) | exit 0, **17 files**, incl. all 8 P4.1a sources |
| `npm run typecheck` | exit 0 |
| `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q` | **12 passed** |

**Negative control.** Exit 0 does not prove a gate works, so a probe file with an unused
variable and an undefined identifier was linted deliberately. ESLint reported the unused
variable as a **warning and still exited 0** — which is why `--max-warnings=0` was added.
It did not flag the undefined identifier at all (`typescript-eslint` disables `no-undef`
and defers to `tsc`); `tsc` raised `TS2304`, confirming lint and typecheck are
complementary and CI must run both. Probe deleted; suites re-run clean.

**Not done, deliberately.** The SQL suites are **not** in CI, so P11.1 is PARTIAL, not
COMPLETE. They need a live Postgres and credentials; the repo cannot rebuild the schema
(BLOCKER-002) and pointing CI at production would mean storing a privileged key in
GitHub secrets. Both are human decisions.

**Not verified.** The workflow has never run on GitHub. Its commands pass locally; the
YAML itself is unproven until a push triggers it.

**TD-010 and TD-011 marked RESOLVED.** No blocker was opened or closed.

## 2026-08-11 · P4.2a — Inventory READ path (production code)

Second domain read service. **Zero migrations, zero schema changes.** Live row counts 0
before and after.

**Production code added**

| File | Lines | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/types/inventory.ts` | 253 | Row + read models for the 4 inventory tables; `StockMovement` as a discriminated union on `item_type`; reason/reference literal unions |
| `packages/validation/inventory.ts` | 143 | Zod schemas mirroring live constraints, incl. the per-reason sign rule |
| `packages/api/queries/inventory.ts` | 418 | The read service: warehouses, both stock-level tables, the ledger |
| `packages/api/internal/read.ts` | 196 | Shared read primitives extracted from catalog |

`packages/api/queries/catalog.ts` shrank 663 → 513 lines: its private copies of
`parseRows`/`parseRow`/`run`/`resolveLimit`/`projectionFor`/`Page` moved into
`internal/read.ts` rather than being duplicated. One response gate, not two.

**Two paging hazards catalog did not have, both handled**

1. `stock_movements.created_at` is **not unique** — a production batch writes every
   consumption and its output in one transaction sharing `now()`. A single-column cursor
   would silently drop siblings. The ledger uses a composite `(created_at, id)` keyset
   cursor. Proven necessary by suite assertion I9.
2. `warehouses.name` is unique per `(tenant_id, branch_id)`, **not** per tenant, so two
   branches may both hold a "Main Store". That list is unpaged instead.

**Executed evidence**

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `tests/sql/inventory_read_rls.sql` (live, BEGIN…ROLLBACK) | **15/15 passed** |
| post-run row counts, 10 tables | **0 rows** |
| `npm run typecheck` | exit 0 |
| `npx eslint packages --max-warnings=0` | exit 0 |

**Finding: the negative-stock policy is already implemented, and the roadmap was wrong
to call it unspecified.** `apply_stock_movement()` enforces it: `sale` and
`production_consume` may never drive stock negative whatever the setting (raises
`insufficient_stock`, P0001); `waste` and `adjustment` may, but only where
`organizations.allow_negative_stock` is true. Found by a fixture failing, then read from
the live function body and proven by assertions I10/I11. The roadmap's "may become a
blocker if unspecified" note is withdrawn. **No blocker was opened** — the rule exists,
it simply was not written down here.

This vindicates `signedQuantitySchema`: an opted-in bakery legitimately stores a negative
`quantity_on_hand`, so a non-negative read schema would have failed on real rows.

**Also fixed:** the P11.1 lint gate immediately caught `BakeflowApiError` left unused in
`catalog.ts` by the extraction — the first defect that gate has paid for.

**Not verified:** full-repo `npm run lint` could not complete — Node aborts
(`0xC0000409`) with 0.35 GB free RAM on this machine. Both scopes pass when run
separately; CI runners are unaffected. Recorded as TD-014.

## 2026-08-11 · P4.2b — Inventory WRITE path (PARTIAL — code done, suite NOT executed)

**Zero migrations, zero schema changes.**

### The mechanism was not what the milestone assumed, and the database said so

The plan was a direct `INSERT INTO stock_movements` via PostgREST. That is **impossible
for an application user**, verified live:

| Fact | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `authenticated` holds **SELECT only** on `stock_movements` | `information_schema.role_table_grants` |
| GRANTs are checked before RLS, so `stock_movements_insert` is unreachable from a client | every test insert returned `42501` |
| `adjust_stock(...)` is SECURITY DEFINER and IS EXECUTE-able by `authenticated` | `has_function_privilege` |

This is deliberate, not a gap. Routing writes through the function is what lets the server
own `created_by` (`auth.uid()`), derive `branch_id` from the warehouse, and write the
`audit_log` row in the same transaction. An INSERT grant would make all three forgeable.
A first implementation built on direct inserts was written and then **discarded** once the
grants were read — it would have failed for every user in production.

### The contract, read from the live function body

```
adjust_stock(p_warehouse_id uuid, p_item_type text, p_item_id uuid,
             p_new_quantity numeric, p_reason text = 'adjustment',
             p_note text = null) RETURNS jsonb
```

- **`p_new_quantity` is an ABSOLUTE TARGET, not a delta.** Reads the level `FOR UPDATE`,
  computes `delta = target - current`. Passing a delta would set stock *to* the delta.
- Accepts only `adjustment`, `waste`, `opening_balance`. The other six reasons belong to
  their own domain flows.
- Target equal to current is a **no-op** returning `unchanged: true` — absolute-target
  semantics give idempotency without any client token.
- Negative target refused. Roles: adjustment/opening_balance need
  owner/admin/branch_manager; waste additionally allows `baker`.
- Returns `to_jsonb(v_movement)`, which renders `numeric` **unquoted** — so every quantity
  in the envelope is already a double. `adjustStock` therefore reads only the `id` from it
  and re-reads the row through `getStockMovementById`, whose projection casts `::text`.

### Production code

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `packages/api/mutations/inventory.ts` | **new**, 196 lines — `adjustStock()` |
| `packages/api/errors/index.ts` | `classifyP0001()` added; normalizer message made domain-neutral |
| `packages/validation/inventory.ts` | sign rule factored out; direct-insert schema removed as unreachable |
| `packages/api/index.ts`, `packages/validation/index.ts` | exports |

`classifyP0001` matters: `adjust_stock` raises plain-text `P0001` with **no** JSON detail,
so without it every authorization and validation failure normalized to `unexpected_error`
— indistinguishable from a bug. The durable fix is for those functions to carry a `DETAIL`
code; that is a database change and was not made.

### Tests

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | **exit 0** |
| `npx eslint packages --max-warnings=0` | **exit 0** |
| `tests/sql/inventory_write_rls.sql` | **NOT EXECUTED** |

The write suite (A0–A12) is written and committed but **was never run**: the database
connection failed with `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mcp.supabase.com` immediately after the
contract was read. No assertion in it may be cited as evidence until it is executed.

**P4.2b is therefore PARTIAL, not COMPLETE.** The contract facts above were each read from
the live database before the outage; the behavioural assertions were not.

## 2026-08-11 · P11.1 CI — diagnosed and fixed; lint/typecheck now actually run

**The failing check was never about production code.** Every CI run since the workflow
was added failed at the **install** step, so `Typecheck` and `Lint` were *skipped* and had
**never executed remotely** — the red mark was an install failure wearing the job's name.

**Evidence gathered before changing anything:**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Was `ci.yml` modified after it was written? | `git diff 3b991e8d HEAD -- .github/workflows/ci.yml` → empty |
| Which step failed? | Runs 31468310603 … 31690359337: all `FAILURE` on `Install`, `SKIPPED` on Typecheck/Lint |
| Lockfile out of sync? | **Excluded** — `corepack npm ci --dry-run` locally → exit 0 |
| Corepack broken locally? | No — `corepack npm --version` → 10.8.2 on Node 24 |
| pytest job | Passed on every run |

Job logs were not readable (`403 Must have admin rights`), so the cause was isolated by
elimination and then by two empirical CI runs.

**Classification: CI workflow problem** (our repository configuration), in two parts:

1. `corepack npm ci` without a prior `corepack enable` fails on the runner. Enabling
   Corepack explicitly fixed that step — run 31822022702 shows it green.
2. `corepack enable` does **not** win the PATH race: measured on the runner, bare
   `npm --version` still reports the version Node 22.13 ships, not 10.8.2. The assertion
   added in the first fix caught this rather than letting a mismatched npm resolve the
   lockfile. The pinned npm is now invoked through `corepack npm` explicitly.

**Result — run 31822495609, all green:**

```
Enable Corepack and activate the pinned npm   SUCCESS
Verify the pinned npm resolves                SUCCESS
Install (pinned npm, ignore-scripts)          SUCCESS
Typecheck                                     SUCCESS
Lint                                          SUCCESS
Spec coverage (pytest)                        SUCCESS
```

Nothing was weakened: `--max-warnings=0`, the npm pin, and `.npmrc ignore-scripts` are all
unchanged. No production code was touched. This is also the first independent confirmation
that the P4.1a/P4.2a/P4.2b packages pass lint and typecheck on a clean machine, which
matters because the combined lint cannot run locally (TD-014).

**Still outstanding for P4.2b:** `tests/sql/inventory_write_rls.sql` remains **NOT
EXECUTED**. The Supabase MCP server disconnected and now requires re-authentication, and
`mcp.supabase.com` does not resolve. P4.2b stays **PARTIAL**.

---

## 2026-08-11 · P4.3a — Production READ path (implemented, schema unverified)

Written while the database was unreachable (Supabase MCP returns 401; `.mcp.json` correct,
DNS resolves, OAuth outstanding). **Zero migrations.**

**Production code:** `packages/types/production.ts`, `packages/validation/production.ts`,
`packages/api/queries/production.ts`, plus three barrels. Reuses the established pattern
throughout — shared read primitives, schema-derived projections, branded `Quantity`,
`::text` on every NUMERIC.

**Provenance, stated plainly:** types and schemas come from `SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md` §5 and
`STATE-MACHINES.md` §2, **not** from a live read. That is a bounded risk rather than a
guess — `SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md` has matched live exactly everywhere checked so far (catalog
§2, inventory §4); the documents that proved wrong were `BACKEND_ROADMAP.md` and
`API-CONTRACT.md`. It must still be verified before P4.3 is COMPLETE.

**Paging differs from the ledger, deliberately.** `batch_number` is `UNIQUE (tenant_id,
batch_number)`, so it totally orders the visible rows and a single-column cursor cannot
skip a sibling. `stock_movements` needed a composite `(created_at, id)` cursor precisely
because it had no such column.

**No mutation was written.** `STATE-MACHINES.md` §2: completion is the single
`complete_production_batch()` RPC and "must not be assembled from separate client calls" —
a partial failure would leave stock consumed with no output movement. The signature will
be read from the live database first, per the `adjust_stock()` precedent.

**A real defect the static gates could not catch.** The projection initially reached for
`.def.innerType` to see through `.refine()`. That is a zod 3 shape; it typechecked only
because it went through an `as unknown as` cast, and would have handed `projectionFor` an
`undefined`, yielding an empty column list and breaking every production read at runtime.
Executed against the installed zod 4.1.12:

```
z.object({...}).refine(...).shape         -> id,planned_quantity,status
z.object({...}).refine(...).def.innerType -> undefined
```

Fixed to use `.shape` directly, then the end-to-end projection was re-probed: **15 batch
columns, 9 line columns, every NUMERIC `::text` cast, no uncast numeric leaked.**

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | exit 0 |
| `eslint` (production files) `--max-warnings=0` | exit 0 |
| **CI run on 3c5f7275** | **SUCCESS** — full lint + typecheck on a Linux runner |
| zod projection probe | 15 / 9 columns, all casts present |
| Live schema verification | **NOT DONE** — database unreachable |
